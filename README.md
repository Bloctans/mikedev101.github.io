## Hey there!

I'm a highschool junior who writes software for fun. I enjoy anime, all things open-source, memes, and more.

### My Stuff

Here are a few of my latest projects.

**[Duck in a Box](https://mikdev101.github.io/Duck_in_a_Box.html)**

Just a cute little animation about a duck who finds one of my boxes.

**[Network Engine](https://mikedev101.github.io/Network-Engine/index.html)**

Network Engine is a Scratch sb3 sprite that enables basic connectivity features over a cloud-variable over websocket connection.

**[Project Yoom!](https://mikedev101.github.io/Yoom/index.html)**

Yoom is a experimental messaging platform using Scratch 3.0 technology.

**[RaspbianX (Discontinued)](https://mikedev101.github.io/RaspbianX/)**

RaspbianX is my custom-built Raspbian Buster Desktop environment for the Raspberry Pi 4, designed to be aesthetically appealing.

### My Scratch 3 Extensions

Here is a directory of my Scratch 3 extensions that I've been working on.

**[Pingas!](https://sheeptester.github.io/scratch-gui/?url=https://mikedev101.github.io/s3exts/pingas.js)**

Literally a useless plugin. But it serves nicely as the basics I need to write future extensions.

**[CloudLink API](https://sheeptester.github.io/scratch-gui/?url=https://mikedev101.github.io/cloudlink/index.js)**

CloudLink API is a Scratch 3.0 websocket extension to enable server-to-client and client-to-server data transfer, designed for low-latency data, massive online multiplayer, advanced chatrooms, etc.
