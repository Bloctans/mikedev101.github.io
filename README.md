## Hey there!

I'm a highschool sophomore (upcoming junior!) who writes software for fun. I enjoy anime, all things open-source, memes, and more.

### My stuff

Here are a few of my latest projects.

**[Network Engine](https://mikedev101.github.io/Network-Engine/index.html)**

**[Project Yoom!](https://mikedev101.github.io/Yoom/index.html)**

**[RaspbianX](https://mikedev101.github.io/RaspbianX)**
