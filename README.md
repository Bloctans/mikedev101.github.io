## Hey there!

I'm a highschool sophomore (upcoming junior!) who writes software for fun. I enjoy anime, all things open-source, memes, and more.

### My Stuff

Here are a few of my latest projects.

**[Network Engine](https://mikedev101.github.io/Network-Engine/index.html)**

Network Engine is a Scratch sb3 sprite that enables basic connectivity features over a cloud-variable over websocket connection.

**[Project Yoom!](https://mikedev101.github.io/Yoom/index.html)**

Yoom is a WIP messaging platform using Scratch 3.0 technology.

**[RaspbianX](https://mikedev101.github.io/RaspbianX/)**

RaspbianX is my custom-built Raspbian Buster Desktop environment for the Raspberry Pi 4, designed to be aesthetically appealing.

### My Scratch 3 Extensions

Here is a directory of my Scratch 3 extensions that I've been working on.

**[Pingas!](https://sheeptester.github.io/scratch-gui/?url=https://mikedev101.github.io/experimental/pingas.js)**

Literally a useless plugin. But it serves nicely as the basics I need to write future extensions.

**[CloudLink](https://sheeptester.github.io/scratch-gui/?url=https://mikedev101.github.io/experimental/cloudlink.js)**

A (work-in-progress) websocket api to enable server-to-client and client-to-server data transfer, designed for low-latency data, massive online multiplayer, advanced chatrooms, etc.
