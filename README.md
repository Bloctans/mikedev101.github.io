## Hey there!

I'm a highschool junior who writes software for fun. I enjoy anime, all things open-source, memes, and more.

### My Stuff

Here are a few of my latest projects.

**[CloudLink API](https://sheeptester.github.io/scratch-gui/?url=https://mikedev101.github.io/cloudlink/)**

CloudLink API is a Scratch 3.0 websocket extension to enable server-to-client and client-to-server data transfer, designed for low-latency data, massive online multiplayer, advanced chatrooms, etc.

**[Project Yoom!](https://mikedev101.github.io/Yoom/index.html)**

Yoom is a experimental messaging platform using Scratch 3.0 technology.
