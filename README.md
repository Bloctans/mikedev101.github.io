## Hey there!

I'm a highschool senior who writes software for fun. I enjoy anime, all things open-source, memes, and more.

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/MDev101) | Mild mature content alert: I wouldn't recommend you following me if you're not 15+.
Discord | MikeDEV#9600, I will be active on my friend's discord server very often
Xbox | MikeDev101, I rarely ever use this, and share it with my older, autistic brother. If you encounter him, please be patient.
