## Welcome to my website!

I'm a highschool junior who writes software for fun. I enjoy anime, open source, memes, and more. Oh, and I'm a total noob when it comes to github, sorry ;-;

### My stuff

Most of my stuff is stored back on Scratch, but I do make projects outside of it. Have a looksies!

### Yoom! Open-Source Internet Messenger and Social Media Platform

This is a Scratch 3.0-powered open source IM and SMP. Powered by Pagekite, Sheeptester's primative cloud server and HTMLifier.
